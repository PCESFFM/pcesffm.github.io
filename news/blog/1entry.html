          <p  style="color:lightgrey;">The recent Fortnite tournament at our school was a great success! Held on December 14th, 2024, this event brought together skilled players to compete for the title of school champion and awesome prizes.</p>
          <p style="color:lightgrey;">The tournament featured 4  intense matches where students paired up in duos to showcase their skills in building and combat. The challenges included the traditional build modes on the season 1 map , adding an extra layer of strategy to the competition.</p>
          <p style="color:lightgrey;">Our standout performers were the duo Jugg boys (João Patraquim and Paulo Alberto Lima) who achieves the top spot with their exceptional gameplay and strategic tactis. They were closely followed by omerta47 (Yassine and Mahmoud Bouabdallah),who put up a strong fight and secured second place. And of couse our third place winners were the duo Chris Heyn Jr support squad (Joe Macintosh and Carlos Hervás).
